# Heart_Disease_Predcition
# Introduction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using a dataset of medical parameters. The model is built using Logistic Regression from the scikit-learn library.
# Dataset
The dataset used is heart_disease_data.csv.
It consists of 303 rows and 14 columns, including features such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and heart rate.
The target variable (target):
1 → Indicates the presence of heart disease.
0 → Indicates no heart disease (healthy heart).
# Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Display the first and last five rows to understand the structure.
Check for missing values (none found).
View basic statistical information about the dataset.
# How to Run the Code
Ensure all dependencies are installed (pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn).
Load the dataset into the project directory.
Run the Python script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
